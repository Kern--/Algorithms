"Mama always said you could do algorithms" - me, as a joke once.

## Algorithms
This project serves as my personal exploration of all of the algorithms and datastructures that I either forgot, never fully understood, or plainly never bothered to learn about. I'm hoping to gather a broad, general knowledge of algorithms and datastructures, as well as hopefully a more intuitive understanding of real world performance (Although that will likely be a stretch as my tests will be contrived)

### Setup
All code will (likely) be written in C, compiled with llvm, and run on a 2013 macbook pro.
